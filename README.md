#Book Club 

Hello, and welcome to the RubyJax Club repo! What's this all about? Let's get started.

###Purpose

Book Club: provide an atmosphere for continuing education as developers through the many books available, and share insights amongst one another. 

This repo: provide code examples for attendees to work with, maintain meeting notes and history as we move along.

###Meetings

Meetings are held monthly, on the first Thursday at 19:00. Currently, we meet at [Ascentis' office](https://www.google.com/maps/place/315+E+Bay+St+%23200,+Jacksonville,+FL+32202/@30.325571,-81.653757,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m2!3m1!1s0x88e5b719445e73b7:0xd47d8de0dc6e63a8?hl=en) in downtown Jacksonville.
